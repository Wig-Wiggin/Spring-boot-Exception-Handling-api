This is a simple CRUD project with Spring Boot application. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to handle some common Exceptions that is created by client side like searching non-existing id.
I used Spring Boot, Mysql, JPA for database operations and Intellij and Postman.
This is just testing project so, free feel to use.
